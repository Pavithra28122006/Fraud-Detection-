# AI-Powered Credit Fraud Detection and Prevention System

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered credit fraud detection and prevention system. The goal is to identify suspicious transactions in real-time, prevent fraudulent activities, and minimize false positives while adapting to evolving threats. This system aims to reduce credit fraud losses, improve detection accuracy, and enhance customer experience through the application of machine learning algorithms, anomaly detection techniques, and real-time data analysis.

## Problem Statement

The core problem addressed is the need for a robust system that can accurately and efficiently detect and prevent credit card fraud in real-time. Traditional methods often struggle with the increasing volume of transactions and the evolving sophistication of fraud tactics, leading to significant financial losses and potential customer dissatisfaction.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this model building project is to develop an accurate machine learning model capable of detecting and preventing credit fraud transactions in real-time. Key objectives include:

* Monitoring transactions in real-time to identify suspicious patterns with high accuracy.
* Minimizing false positives to ensure a positive customer experience.
* Leveraging machine learning models and behavioral analytics to detect anomalies and evolving fraud tactics.
* Ensuring the system is scalable to handle large transaction volumes.
* Providing model interpretability to understand the factors driving fraud detection.
* Optimizing model performance for efficiency and speed.
